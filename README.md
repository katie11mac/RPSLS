# RPSLS

Inspired by the Big Bang Theory, this app, coded in Swift, is the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, but with a more exciting and fun twist. 
RPSLS (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock) consists of two new elements: lizard and spock. 

The rules on the game are below: 
- scissors cuts paper
- paper covers rock 
- rock crushes lizard 
- lizard poisons Spock
- spock smashes scissors 
- scissors decapitates lizard
- lizard eats paper
- paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes Rock
- rock crushes scissors
